                  <div class="c"><p>Ghost Matter is an extremely hazardous substance found throughout the Solar System. While invisible to the naked eye, it can be detected by the camera or Little Scout. When photographed, it appears as a blue-green aura in the air. It can also be detected by the presence of blueish-silver crystals, as these Ghost Matter Crystals usually indicate the presence of Ghost Matter.</p></div>
                  <div class="c"><p>Ghost Matter was brought to the system within the The Interloper, a comet that had recently entered the Solar System during the Nomai civilization. The Nomai detected the comet's arrival shortly after the failure of the Sun Station. Upon investigation, the Nomai explorers Poke and Pye discovered a way below the surface of the comet and discovered within an incredibly dense, highly pressurized core of exotic matter. Their tests indicated that the core was at risk of rupturing as the comet approached the Sun, and the resulting release of exotic matter could eradicate all life in the Solar System. Before they could warn their clan of the danger, the core ruptured, killing the Nomai explorers and all Nomai in the Solar System instantly. This event ended all Nomai life within the solar system, leaving behind only the remnants of their civilization.</p></div>
